## Features

- **Fine-Tuned Language Model**: Utilizes the LLAMA 3 8B model fine-tuned on customer support data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrates RAG technique to enhance the chatbot's performance.
- **PyTorch and Colab**: Developed using PyTorch and Google Colab, leveraging its free T4 GPU.
- **Hugging Face Dataset**: Trained on the Bitext customer support dataset available on Hugging Face.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
